The general target will be to predict whether someone should be approved for a credit card. Most columns will be relevant, particularly held debt, existing credit score, income, marital status, and employment time. Two columns (Gender and Ethnicity) are included and may have interesting collateral correlations for approvals but should probably not be used for final model predictions for ethical reasons.
